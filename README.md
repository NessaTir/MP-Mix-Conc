# MP Mixture Concentration experiment
In this repository you'll find all raw data as well as the code we used to process these for our paper [**Increasing microplastic concentrations have nonlinear impacts on the physiology of reef-building corals**](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.178318).

(I) We investigated the concentration-dependent effects of the MP mixture on the physiology of the coral host (i.e., growth rates of tissue area and volume, calcification, necrosis, and polyp activity)
and the photosynthetic efficiency of the photosymbionts (i.e., effective quantum yield, the maximum quantum yield, relative electron transport rate, minimum saturating irradiance, and efficiency of light capture).
(II) We analyzed the dose-response relationships to determine whether they follow linear or more complex patterns. 

For the statistical assessment and data visualization we used the statistical **R** Project for Statistical Computing Software together with the graphical user interface **RStudio**.

## General terminology
Sampling timepoints are referred to as:
   t0 - before the addition of microplastics
   t1 - 4 weeks after the addition of microplastics
   t2 - 8 weeks after the addition of microplastics
   t3 - 12 weeks after the addition of microplastics
   
Used coral species are referred to as:
   Pve - _Pocillopora verrucosa_ 
   Spi - _Stylophora pistillata_
   
Used microplastic polymers:
   PE -  black polyethylene fragments
   PVC - grey polyvinyl chloride fragments
   PS -  beige polystyrene fragments
   PP -  red polypropylene fibers
   PET - blue polyester fibers
   PA -  yellow polyamide fibers

Used microplastic concentrations:
   control -               0 mg/L
   low pollution -       0.1 mg/L
   moderate pollution -    1 mg/L
   high pollution -       10 mg/L
   extreme pollution -   100 mg/L
