# MP Mixture Concentration experiment
In this repository you'll find all raw data as well as the code we used to process these for our manuscript **MP-Mix-Conc**.

We analyzed
(I) the health of the coral host (i.e., growth rates: tissue area, volume, calcification; and necrosis),
(II) the behavior of the coral host (i.e., polyp activity),
and (III) the photosynthetic efficiency of the coralsâ€™ photosymbionts (i.e., effective quantum yield and relative electron transport rate)
of the reef-building corals _Pocillopora verrucosa_ and _Stylophora pistillata_. 
For the statistical assessment and data visualization we used the statistical **R** Project for Statistical Computing Software together with the graphical user interface **RStudio**.
